[DeformXfer](https://github.com/jerenchen/deformxfer) is an [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org)/[libIGL](https://libigl.github.io) (C++) implementation of ["Deformation Transfer for Triangle Meshes"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/), largely based on the Python implementation of ["Landmark-guided Deformation Transfer of Template Facial Expressions for Automatic Generation of Avatar Blendshapes"](https://github.com/diegothomas/Avatar-generation-3DRW2019-).
